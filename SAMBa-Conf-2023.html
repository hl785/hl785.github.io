                            A few mathematicians have had considerable influence in the last two years over whether
                            people
                            lived and flourished, or died. Some mathematicians have focussed on designing and
                            implementing
                            mathematical models which only consider a single illness. Applied statisticians know that it
                            is
                            critical to first decide what the question is: "Minimise deaths from Covid-19?" or "Minimise
                            deaths due to Covid-19 and our decisions this year?" or "Minimise the impact of Covid-19 on
                            well-being over ten years?" The ethical status of an expert who gives a simple answer to the
                            first question, without uncertainty or alternatives, will be examined.
                            <p>Some publications by influential mathematics groups were directly misleading: in
                                estimating
                                cases of Covid-19, the assumption, made by prominent mathematicians, that PCR test had
                                sensitivity of effectively 100%, and specificity of 80-90%, relied on gross misreading
                                of
                                the references cited. People were placed under effect house arrest, when, on balance of
                                probability, they were innocent of covid.
                            <p>Numbers of "covid" hospitalisations and deaths were quoted without reference to the usual
                                daily numbers, and contributed to created a climate of fear. Predictions of 6,000 UK
                                hospital admissions per day in January 2022 relied on the assumption that South African
                                scientists are incompetent. Their statement that omicron variant of covid-19 has much
                                lower
                                admission and death rates was ignored. I will discuss whether this can be construed as
                                racism, and compare the issues with ideas of racial inequity in UK covid death rates.
                            </p>
                            <p>The uncertainty in diagnostic tests, missing information and measurement errors all feed
                                into
                                transmitted variation. Even in manufacturing glass beads, the variation from engineering
                                specification is not simply determined by considering width, for example, alone. Despite
                                this, mathematical predictions of covid cases were used to justify lockdowns even in
                                countries where people would starve as a consequence. Some statisticians have tried to
                                estimate the damage to children's education and wellbeing, and illness and deaths due to
                                lack of access.
                            </p>
                            <p>I argue that such mathematical modelling cannot be justified within virtue,
                                deontological,
                                utilitarian or care ethics, though Zoroaster or Nietzsche might be invoked. It is always
                                necessary to consider the wider context, and the probable consequences of actions, as
                                explained in the International Statistics Institute Code of Professional Ethics.
                                Assessment
                                of the validity of model assumptions, data quality, adequacy of the fit of models and
                                accuracy of predictions is essential, and essentially statistical.

                            Stochastic reaction-diffusion simulations have been successfully used in a number of
                            biological
                            applications, ranging in size from
                            spatio-temporal modelling in molecular and cell biology to stochastic modelling of groups of
                            animals. I will discuss connections and
                            differences between various stochastic reaction-diffusion methodologies, between stochastic

                            deterministic modelling, and some
                            interesting open mathematical problems. The methods covered will include Brownian dynamics,
                            compartment-based (lattice-based) models,
                            and (all-atom and coarse-grained) molecular dynamics simulations.</div>

                            storage,

                            Mathematics is a difficult subject to communicate, from the abstract ideas and complicated

                            maths as a subject that's difficult and boring - but it's so important to engage people with

                                We explore how the demographic composition of neighbourhoods influences the risk of an
                                infectious disease outbreak and the early stages
                                of its spread through the population. Infection spreads via transmission between
                                individuals; transmission depends on the contacts and
                                the structure of contacts within a population is influenced by the spatial arrangement
                                of
                                individuals. In particular, we might consider
                                contacts at a household scale, hence distinguishing between the often stronger
                                transmission
                                within the household and weaker transmission
                                within the wider community. The small number of people in each household means that
                                random
                                events can be important, and models usually
                                take a stochastic approach based on Markov processes.

                                <p> In this talk, we will introduce a multi-scale metapopulation framework for a
                                    population
                                    of two neighbourhoods of households. We then
                                    use both analytic and numerical methodologies to understand how household size and
                                    connectivity between the neighbourhoods influences
                                    outbreak probability, infection risk and spread of infection between the two
                                    neighbourhoods. This research can inform surveillance and
                                    control strategies.

                                conscientious and well-informed public who are aware of and prepared to follow advice.
                                Unfortunately, public health messages can be undermined by
                                competing misinformation and conspiracy theories, spread virally through communities
                                that

                                awareness spread are widely used in the literature to explore the effects of information

                                individuals who reject better quality information and have overall riskier behaviour. We
                                show that, as the density of the distrusting population increases,
                                the model passes through a phase transition to a state in which major outbreaks cannot
                                be
                                suppressed. Our work highlights the urgent need for effective interventions

                                The derivation of continuum equations from a discrete deterministic system of particles

                                of major interest. This is an area of research in mathematical physics originating from
                                Hilbert's Sixth Problem in 1900. This problem has been approached in two steps using the
                                Boltzmann equation as a mesoscopic description. The first one is to derive kinetic
                                equations, such as the Boltzmann equation, from a system of particles and the second is
                                to
                                derive continuum equations, such as Navier-Stokes and Euler equations, from the

                                suitable limit of many small particles. As a second one is the derivation of diffusive

                                regime; that is, when the law of large numbers
                                for the position of the random walk is \(X_n/n \to 0\), even if the random walk is

                                conditions, Berger and Salvi (2020) proved an annealed
                                scaling limit. I will explain that it is impossible to extend this statement to a
                                quenched
                                result, which would correspond to a limit in

                                Homogenization refers to the approximation of PDEs with rapidly oscillating coefficients

                                (constant coefficient) PDE. Physically, we can think of a composite that is obtained by

                                    In other words, there is a loss of ellipticity in the limit. I will explain the main
                                    ideas behind the operator theoretic
                                    framework developed by Cherednichenko, Ershova, and Kiselev (2020). The key object

                                    that of a "boundary triple" in
                                    the sense of Ryzhov (2009). This gives us approximations in the operator norm, which

                                the urn tends to a Dirichlet distributed
                                random variable with parameter given by the urn's initial composition. If R is

                                this limit is a deterministic vector
                                that only depends on R. Fluctuations around these limits are also known.

                                <p>Recently, for the identity replacement matrix, results have been shown on the
                                    asymptotic
                                    behaviour of the urn when the initial
                                    number of balls grows together with the number of time steps. In this talk, I will
                                    show

                                    replacement matrix. This includes the asymptotic behaviour of the proportion of each

                                    around this limit.

                                One of the key problems in flood estimation is to predict the flow in the river after an

                                and data-based models were constructed to address this problem; however, they are often
                                based on completely different assumptions
                                and their limits of applicability remain unknown. During the talk I am going to give an

                                currently used models. We start by
                                constructing a simple benchmark scenario for coupled surface-subsurface flows. Then we
                                use
